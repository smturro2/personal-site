            BlackRock was a large shift from the smaller companies I had previously worked at.
            I saw the importance of DevOps and MLOps in quant finance. I got a taste of
            the big apple, and it was fun being an intern again in my mid-twenties.

            Working as a Financial Engineer at a hedge fund gave me practical work experience after college. I worked
            alongside the risk management team to develop new cashflow models for the Alternative Credit & Fixed Income (ACFI) business.
            I learned foundational concepts such as strong correlations in tails and the importance of diversification.
            My favorite project involved leveraging my programming skills to deploy a python package for the front office. In doing so, I
            learned multi-name credit modeling from senior researchers and container orchestration from computer engineers.

                                    Scott was our remote software intern for the summer of 2021 and he was phenomenal. His time was focused on three projects and he was highly beneficial to each.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On one project he got to demonstrate his prior knowledge on quantum tomography. He was immediately competent and easily picked up the newer parts regarding instrument control. Even knowing this was something he had experience with, we were still impressed by how quickly he made real progress.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Scott also seems to have the right intuition for efficiently working on technical tasks. He would push the task along, notice when something seems amiss, verify that his work was correct, and then bring it up politely. As a remote employee he had no means to debug hardware and there were multiple times hardware issues came up. Scott's patient approach to these scenarios ensured his portion was correct and enabled us to get him up and running again quickly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Scott was always friendly and eager to contribute. He made sure we were set up for success at the conclusion of his internship by writing documentation for the code as well as spending some time handing off various scripts. On all projects, he regularly brought and implemented valuable ideas that we wouldn't have picked up anywhere else.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Scott will be a strong asset to any organization and I'd hire him back in a heartbeat.

            Kwiat's research group explores and implements innovative Quantum protocols. As I freshman I was given the task
            to repair an online interface that calculated quantum state tomography. By my junior year I turned
            this script into a publicly available python package available on PyPi where it has received thousands of downloads.
            Professor Kwiat does such a great job managing the group. The people are helpful and a family vibe radiates through the meetings.
