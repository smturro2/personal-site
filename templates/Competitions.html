            I was invited to participate in JP Morgan’s Code for Good Hack-a-thon.
            Through a virtual event with a team of five other members, we were 
            challenged with developing a website for a non-profit organization
            that promotes young girls to participate in sports. We had 24 hours 
            to create the webpage, message board, and database of users using python 
            and html. This was a great exposure to working effectively in a team environment. Our team
            was awarded 1st place by the non-profit organization.

        <p> This hackathon's challenge was to develop an application that utilized quantum technology. In under 30 hours I
            independently developed a web interface to input different stock portfolios. Then the backend used
            Qiskit's quantum optimization algorithms to perform portfolio optimization. To make the challenge more difficult,
            I decided to implement a 'fund of funds' optimization, meaning you were limited to investing index funds instead
            of individual stocks. I placed third in this competition.</p>

                    During my senior year of high school, I won the US Congressional App Challenge
                    for the 3rd District of Illinois. Although the nature of the app, a nostalgic water
                    ring game, was simple in nature, I challenged myself by developing my own physics engine.
                    This was my first major coding project. Utilizing hydrodynamic drag, I simulated the rings
                    floating in water. I also factored in the gyroscope of the phone to determine how the rings
                    would fall. It was shocking experience to be present my app to congressman in washington DC.

        The competitions I competed in for Bussiness Professionals of America were technical in nature.
        My best subject was the fundamentals of SQL. My first year I placed 7th in state and the following
        year I placed 2nd. This qualified me for the national competition however I was unable to compete
        due to my commitment to the mens gymnastics team.

        <p>
            My junior and senior year of high school I was captain of the mens gymnastics team. I lead stretches before
            and after practice and resolved issues. These issues were sometimes personal or internal
            to our organization. We place second in state this year losing by .2 points. This is the equivalent to
            a single gymnast taking an extra step on the landing.
